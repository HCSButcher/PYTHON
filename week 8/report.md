# CORD-19 Data Exploration Project

## Findings

- The dataset contains COVID-19 research papers from multiple years.
- Most publications are from 2020 and 2021.
- Top journals include _medRxiv_ and _bioRxiv_.
- Word frequency analysis shows common words like "covid-19", "sars-cov-2", and "coronavirus".

## Challenges

- Some rows had missing dates and titles, which we had to drop.
- The dataset was large, so we worked with a cleaned version.

## Learning

- Practiced data cleaning with pandas (handling NaN values, date parsing).
- Learned basic visualization with Matplotlib.
- Built an interactive dashboard using Streamlit.
